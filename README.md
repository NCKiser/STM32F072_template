This is a Kicad Template project (that also happens to be a dev-board) for the STM32F072CBT6.

***THIS PROJECT IS NOT PIN-COMPATIBLE OR PHYSICALLY COMPATIBLE WITH PROJECTS THAT USE A BLACKPILL OR ANY OTHER STM DEV-BOARD***

**THIS IS NOT A BLACKPILL OR BLUEPILL REPLACEMENT**

****See this video for turning this template into a BlackPill-compatible dev board:**** https://youtu.be/LvX-Us9VZM0
